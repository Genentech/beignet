    r"""
    Compute statistical power for one-sample and paired t-tests.

    This function calculates the probability of correctly rejecting the null
    hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true for a one-sample t-test
    or a paired-samples t-test.

    This function is differentiable with respect to all tensor parameters.
    While traditional power analysis doesn't require gradients, differentiability
    enables integration into machine learning pipelines where effect sizes or
    sample sizes might be learned parameters or part of experimental design
    optimization.

    When to Use
    -----------
    **Traditional Statistics:**
    - Planning sample sizes for experimental studies
    - Determining if non-significant results indicate lack of power
    - Reporting statistical power in research publications
    - Retrospective power analysis to interpret null findings

    **Machine Learning Contexts:**
    - Validating A/B test designs for ML model deployments
    - Planning data collection for training set curation
    - Evaluating statistical significance in model performance comparisons
    - Hyperparameter optimization: determining sample sizes for cross-validation
    - Active learning: estimating power to detect performance improvements
    - Federated learning: power analysis for detecting effects across distributed data
    - AutoML: automated statistical testing of model configurations
    - Experimental design for synthetic data generation validation

    **Use one-sample t-test power when:**
    - Comparing a single group mean to a known population value
    - Testing if model performance differs from a benchmark threshold
    - Validating if learned representations achieve target properties

    **Use paired t-test power when:**
    - Comparing before/after measurements on the same subjects
    - Cross-validation comparisons of different ML models on same data
    - Comparing model performance across different data preprocessing approaches
    - Measuring improvement from model updates or retraining

    **Choose t-test over other tests when:**
    - Data is approximately normally distributed
    - Continuous outcome variables
    - Independent observations (for one-sample) or paired observations
    - Sample size is moderate (n ≥ 30) or population is normal

    Parameters
    ----------
    effect_size : Tensor
        Standardized effect size (Cohen's d). For one-sample tests, this is
        (μ - μ₀) / σ where μ is the true mean, μ₀ is the null hypothesis mean,
        and σ is the population standard deviation. For paired tests, this is
        the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of differences.

    sample_size : Tensor
        Sample size (number of observations). For paired tests, this is the
        number of pairs.

    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level (Type I error rate).

    alternative : str, default="two-sided"
        Type of alternative hypothesis. Either "two-sided" or "one-sided".

    out : Tensor, optional
        Output tensor. Default, `None`.

    Returns
    -------
    output : Tensor
        Statistical power (probability of correctly rejecting false null hypothesis).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> effect_size = torch.tensor(0.5)
    >>> sample_size = torch.tensor(30)
    >>> t_test_power(effect_size, sample_size)
    tensor(0.6947)

    Notes
    -----
    The power calculation uses the noncentral t-distribution. Under the null
    hypothesis, the test statistic follows t(df) where df = n - 1. Under the
    alternative hypothesis, it follows a noncentral t-distribution with
    noncentrality parameter:

    δ = d * √n

    Where d is Cohen's d effect size and n is the sample size.

    For computational efficiency, we use normal approximations for large
    sample sizes and accurate noncentral t-distribution calculations for
    smaller samples.

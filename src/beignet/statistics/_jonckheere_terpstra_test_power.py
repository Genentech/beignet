    Power analysis for the Jonckheere-Terpstra test.

    The Jonckheere-Terpstra test is a non-parametric test for ordered alternatives
    in independent groups. It tests the null hypothesis that all groups have
    identical distributions against the alternative that the distributions are
    ordered (e.g., μ₁ ≤ μ₂ ≤ μ₃ ≤ ... with at least one strict inequality).

    This function is differentiable with respect to all tensor parameters.
    While traditional power analysis doesn't require gradients, differentiability
    enables integration into machine learning pipelines where effect sizes or
    sample sizes might be learned parameters or part of experimental design
    optimization.

    When to Use
    -----------
    **Traditional Statistics:**
    - Dose-response studies with ordered treatment levels
    - Clinical trials with ordered severity groups or treatment intensities
    - Educational research with ordered grade levels or intervention intensities
    - Agricultural experiments with ordered fertilizer concentrations
    - Quality control with ordered process conditions or material grades
    - Psychology studies with ordered stimulus intensities or exposure levels

    **Machine Learning Contexts:**
    - Hyperparameter optimization with ordered parameter values
    - Model complexity evaluation with ordered architectural complexity
    - Active learning with ordered query complexity or information content
    - Transfer learning with ordered domain similarity levels
    - Ensemble methods with ordered model complexity or contribution levels
    - Computer vision with ordered image complexity or resolution levels
    - NLP with ordered text complexity, length, or difficulty levels
    - Recommendation systems with ordered preference intensities
    - Anomaly detection with ordered anomaly severity levels
    - Feature engineering with ordered feature transformation complexity
    - Cross-validation with ordered training set sizes or complexity
    - Time series analysis with ordered temporal periods or seasons

    **Choose Jonckheere-Terpstra over other tests when:**
    - Have 3 or more independent groups with natural ordering
    - Expect monotonic trend across ordered groups rather than arbitrary differences
    - Data may not meet normality assumptions for parametric trend tests
    - Want robust test that doesn't depend on specific distributional assumptions
    - Interested in trend detection rather than specific pairwise comparisons

    **Choose this over Kruskal-Wallis when:**
    - Groups have natural ordering and expect monotonic trend
    - Want higher power for detecting ordered alternatives
    - Trend direction is specified a priori (one-sided test)
    - Research hypothesis specifically involves ordered progression

    **Interpretation Guidelines:**
    - Test is one-sided by nature (tests for ordered trend)
    - Effect size represents standardized trend across ordered groups
    - Power increases with larger sample sizes and stronger monotonic trends
    - Assumes independence between groups but not normality
    - More powerful than Kruskal-Wallis when ordered alternative is true
    - Less powerful than parametric trend tests when normality assumptions hold

    Parameters
    ----------
    effect_size : Tensor
        Effect size representing the standardized trend across ordered groups.
        This should be the slope coefficient divided by the standard error
        in the rank regression context.
    sample_sizes : Tensor, shape=(..., k)
        Sample sizes for each of the k ordered groups.
    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level (one-tailed).

    Returns
    -------
    output : Tensor, shape=(...)
        Statistical power values in range [0, 1].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> effect_size = torch.tensor(0.5)
    >>> sample_sizes = torch.tensor([15, 15, 15, 15])
    >>> jonckheere_terpstra_test_power(effect_size, sample_sizes)
    tensor(0.8456)

    Notes
    -----
    The Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic J is the sum of Mann-Whitney U statistics
    for all ordered pairs of groups:

    J = Σ_{i<j} U_{ij}

    Under H₀, J has mean μ₀ = N²/4 and variance σ₀².
    Under H₁, it has mean μ₁ > μ₀.

    The test statistic is approximately normal for large samples:
    Z = (J - μ₀) / σ₀

    The noncentrality parameter depends on the ordered nature of the alternative
    and the effect size across groups.

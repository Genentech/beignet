    r"""
    Power analysis for intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

    Tests whether the ICC differs significantly from zero, indicating
    reliability or agreement among raters/measurements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    icc : Tensor
        Expected ICC under the alternative hypothesis.
        Range is [0, 1] for ICC(2,1) and ICC(3,1) models.
    n_subjects : Tensor
        Number of subjects being rated/measured.
    n_raters : Tensor
        Number of raters or repeated measurements per subject.
    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level.
    alternative : {"two-sided", "greater", "less"}, default="two-sided"
        Alternative hypothesis direction.

    Returns
    -------
    output : Tensor, shape=(...)
        Statistical power values in range [0, 1].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> icc = torch.tensor(0.7)  # Good reliability
    >>> n_subjects = torch.tensor(30)
    >>> n_raters = torch.tensor(3)
    >>> intraclass_correlation_power(icc, n_subjects, n_raters)
    tensor(0.8923)

    Notes
    -----
    The ICC is tested using an F-test of the form:
    F = MS_between / MS_within

    Under H₀: ICC = 0 (no reliability)
    Under H₁: ICC > 0 (some reliability)

    The relationship between ICC and F-statistic depends on the ICC model:
    - ICC(2,1): F = (1 + (k-1)*ICC) / (1 - ICC)
    - ICC(3,1): Similar relationship with slight variations

    This implementation uses the ICC(2,1) model (two-way random effects,
    single measurement, absolute agreement).

    ICC interpretation guidelines:
    - ICC < 0.50: Poor reliability
    - 0.50 ≤ ICC < 0.75: Moderate reliability
    - 0.75 ≤ ICC < 0.90: Good reliability
    - ICC ≥ 0.90: Excellent reliability

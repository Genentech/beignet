    Power analysis for intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

    Tests whether the ICC differs significantly from zero, indicating
    reliability or agreement among raters/measurements.

    When to Use
    -----------
    **Traditional Statistics:**
    - Test-retest reliability studies for continuous measurements
    - Inter-rater reliability assessment with multiple raters
    - Instrument validation studies measuring measurement consistency
    - Clinical research evaluating assessment tool reliability
    - Survey research validating scale reliability across raters

    **Machine Learning Contexts:**
    - Annotation reliability: assessing consistency across multiple human annotators
    - Model ensemble evaluation: measuring agreement between multiple model predictions
    - Cross-validation reliability: assessing model performance consistency across folds
    - Feature reliability: evaluating consistency of engineered features across datasets
    - Active learning: measuring annotation quality consistency across query strategies
    - Multi-task learning: assessing consistency of shared representations across tasks
    - Federated learning: evaluating model consistency across participating institutions
    - Domain adaptation: measuring feature consistency across source and target domains
    - Hyperparameter optimization: assessing performance consistency across parameter settings
    - Time series validation: measuring model consistency across different time periods

    **Choose ICC over other reliability measures when:**
    - Continuous or ordinal ratings (not categorical classifications)
    - Multiple raters or repeated measurements (not just two raters)
    - Interest is in absolute agreement or consistency
    - Data has natural clustering structure (subjects with repeated measures)
    - Need to decompose variance into between-subject and within-subject components

    **Choose ICC over Cohen's kappa when:**
    - Ratings are continuous rather than categorical
    - More than two raters are involved
    - Interest is in consistency rather than exact agreement
    - Data represents measurements on a continuous scale

    **Choose ICC over Cronbach's alpha when:**
    - Raters are not interchangeable (e.g., different measurement occasions)
    - Interest is in test-retest reliability rather than internal consistency
    - Multiple measurement occasions rather than multiple items

    **Interpretation Guidelines:**
    - ICC < 0.50: Poor reliability (measurements not dependable)
    - ICC 0.50-0.74: Moderate reliability (acceptable for research)
    - ICC 0.75-0.89: Good reliability (suitable for clinical decisions)
    - ICC ≥ 0.90: Excellent reliability (gold standard for clinical use)

    Parameters
    ----------
    icc : Tensor
        Expected ICC under the alternative hypothesis.
        Range is [0, 1] for ICC(2,1) and ICC(3,1) models.
    n_subjects : Tensor
        Number of subjects being rated/measured.
    n_raters : Tensor
        Number of raters or repeated measurements per subject.
    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level.
    alternative : {"two-sided", "greater", "less"}, default="two-sided"
        Alternative hypothesis direction.

    Returns
    -------
    output : Tensor, shape=(...)
        Statistical power values in range [0, 1].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> icc = torch.tensor(0.7)  # Good reliability
    >>> n_subjects = torch.tensor(30)
    >>> n_raters = torch.tensor(3)
    >>> intraclass_correlation_power(icc, n_subjects, n_raters)
    tensor(0.8923)

    Notes
    -----
    The ICC is tested using an F-test of the form:
    F = MS_between / MS_within

    Under H₀: ICC = 0 (no reliability)
    Under H₁: ICC > 0 (some reliability)

    The relationship between ICC and F-statistic depends on the ICC model:
    - ICC(2,1): F = (1 + (k-1)*ICC) / (1 - ICC)
    - ICC(3,1): Similar relationship with slight variations

    This implementation uses the ICC(2,1) model (two-way random effects,
    single measurement, absolute agreement).

    ICC interpretation guidelines:
    - ICC < 0.50: Poor reliability
    - 0.50 ≤ ICC < 0.75: Moderate reliability
    - 0.75 ≤ ICC < 0.90: Good reliability
    - ICC ≥ 0.90: Excellent reliability

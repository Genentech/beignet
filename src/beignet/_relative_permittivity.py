    r"""
    Calculate relative permittivity based on input features, charges, and temperature.

    The relative permittivity (dielectric constant) is calculated using a
    temperature-dependent Debye relaxation model:

    ε_r = ε_s + (ε_inf - ε_s) / [1 + (τ_D * ω)²]

    where:
    - ε_s is the static permittivity (low frequency limit)
    - ε_inf is the optical permittivity (high frequency limit)
    - τ_D is the Debye relaxation time following Arrhenius: τ_D = τ_0 * exp(E_a / (k_B * T))
    - ω is a frequency-like term derived from charges and input features

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : Tensor, shape=(*, C, ...)
        Input features (e.g., local density, potential, or learned features).
        Can have arbitrary spatial dimensions after the channel dimension.
    charges : Tensor, shape=(*, ...)
        Ionic charges. Will be converted to float internally to maintain gradients.
        Should be broadcastable with input.
    temperature : Tensor, scalar or shape=(*)
        Absolute temperature in Kelvin. Can be a scalar or batched.
    eps_s : float, optional
        Static permittivity. Default is 78.4 (water at room temperature).
    eps_inf : float, optional
        High-frequency permittivity. Default is 4.5 (water).
    tau_0 : float, optional
        Pre-exponential factor for Debye relaxation time in seconds. Default is 1e-11.
    E_a : float, optional
        Activation energy in Joules. Default is 2e-20.

    Returns
    -------
    permittivity : Tensor, shape=broadcast(input.shape, charges.shape, temperature.shape)
        Relative permittivity (dimensionless).

    Notes
    -----
    - The operator is fully differentiable and compatible with autograd.
    - Supports torch.compile with fullgraph=True (no graph breaks).
    - Compatible with torch.func transformations (vmap, grad, etc.).
    - Uses Boltzmann constant k_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Single point calculation
    >>> input = torch.randn(3, 10, 10)  # 3 channels, 10x10 spatial
    >>> charges = torch.tensor(1.0)  # single charge value
    >>> temp = torch.tensor(300.0)  # 300 K
    >>> eps_r = beignet.relative_permittivity(input, charges, temp)
    >>> eps_r.shape
    torch.Size([3, 10, 10])

    >>> # Batched calculation with varying temperatures
    >>> input = torch.randn(5, 3, 8, 8)  # batch=5, channels=3, 8x8 spatial
    >>> charges = torch.randn(5, 1, 1)  # per-batch charges
    >>> temps = torch.linspace(200, 400, 5)  # different temperatures
    >>> eps_r = beignet.relative_permittivity(input, charges, temps.view(5, 1, 1, 1))
    >>> eps_r.shape
    torch.Size([5, 3, 8, 8])

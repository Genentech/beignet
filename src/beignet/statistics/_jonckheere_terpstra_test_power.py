    Power analysis for the Jonckheere-Terpstra test.

    The Jonckheere-Terpstra test is a non-parametric test for ordered alternatives
    in independent groups. It tests the null hypothesis that all groups have
    identical distributions against the alternative that the distributions are
    ordered (e.g., μ₁ ≤ μ₂ ≤ μ₃ ≤ ... with at least one strict inequality).

    Parameters
    ----------
    effect_size : Tensor
        Effect size representing the standardized trend across ordered groups.
        This should be the slope coefficient divided by the standard error
        in the rank regression context.
    sample_sizes : Tensor, shape=(..., k)
        Sample sizes for each of the k ordered groups.
    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level (one-tailed).

    Returns
    -------
    output : Tensor, shape=(...)
        Statistical power values in range [0, 1].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> effect_size = torch.tensor(0.5)
    >>> sample_sizes = torch.tensor([15, 15, 15, 15])
    >>> jonckheere_terpstra_test_power(effect_size, sample_sizes)
    tensor(0.8456)

    Notes
    -----
    The Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic J is the sum of Mann-Whitney U statistics
    for all ordered pairs of groups:

    J = Σ_{i<j} U_{ij}

    Under H₀, J has mean μ₀ = N²/4 and variance σ₀².
    Under H₁, it has mean μ₁ > μ₀.

    The test statistic is approximately normal for large samples:
    Z = (J - μ₀) / σ₀

    The noncentrality parameter depends on the ordered nature of the alternative
    and the effect size across groups.

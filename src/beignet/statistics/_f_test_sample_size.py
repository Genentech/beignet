    Compute required sample size for general F-tests.

    Given the effect size, numerator degrees of freedom, desired power, and
    significance level, this function calculates the minimum total sample size
    needed to achieve the specified power for a general F-test.

    This function is differentiable with respect to effect_size and df1 parameters.
    While traditional sample size calculations don't require gradients,
    differentiability enables integration into machine learning pipelines where
    effect sizes might be learned parameters or part of experimental design
    optimization.

    When to Use
    -----------
    **Traditional Statistics:**
    - Multiple regression: planning sample sizes to detect R² changes
    - ANOVA: planning sample sizes for general linear model comparisons
    - Nested model testing: planning comparisons between restricted/unrestricted models
    - Experimental design: planning factorial experiments with multiple factors
    - Clinical trials: planning sample sizes for multivariable treatment comparisons
    - Quality control: planning multivariate process monitoring studies

    **Machine Learning Contexts:**
    - Model comparison: planning studies to compare nested model architectures
    - Feature selection: planning studies to detect feature set importance
    - Hyperparameter optimization: planning studies to detect parameter importance
    - Cross-validation: planning studies for nested model validation
    - Ensemble methods: planning studies to compare ensemble component contributions
    - Transfer learning: planning studies to detect domain-specific feature importance
    - Active learning: planning studies to compare multi-dimensional selection strategies
    - Regularization studies: planning comparisons between different penalty approaches
    - Causal inference: planning studies to detect multivariable treatment effects
    - Computer vision: planning studies to compare multi-layer feature contributions
    - NLP: planning studies to compare multi-feature language model components
    - Recommendation systems: planning studies to compare multi-factor rating predictions

    **Choose F-tests over t-tests when:**
    - Testing multiple parameters simultaneously (df1 > 1)
    - Comparing nested models with different numbers of parameters
    - Need to control Type I error across multiple comparisons
    - Testing overall effect of a factor with multiple levels

    **Choose general F-test over specific tests when:**
    - Effect size is expressed as f² or R² change
    - Working with general linear models or regression contexts
    - Need flexibility in specifying degrees of freedom
    - Comparing models that don't fit standard ANOVA or t-test designs

    **Interpretation Guidelines:**
    - Effect size f² = R²/(1-R²) for regression contexts
    - f² = 0.02 (small), 0.15 (medium), 0.35 (large) following Cohen's conventions
    - Sample size N should exceed df1 + 10 for stable results
    - Larger df1 (more parameters) requires larger sample sizes
    - Consider model complexity and overfitting with small samples
    - Assumes normality and homogeneity of variance

    Parameters
    ----------
    effect_size : Tensor
        Effect size (Cohen's f² or similar). This represents the magnitude of
        the effect being tested. For regression contexts, this could be the
        R² change or similar measure. Should be positive.

    df1 : Tensor
        Degrees of freedom for the numerator (effect).

    power : float, default=0.8
        Desired statistical power (probability of correctly rejecting false null).

    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level (Type I error rate).

    out : Tensor, optional
        Output tensor. Default, `None`.

    Returns
    -------
    output : Tensor
        Required total sample size (rounded up to nearest integer).
        The denominator degrees of freedom will be approximately output - df1 - 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> effect_size = torch.tensor(0.15)  # Cohen's f² = 0.15 (medium effect)
    >>> df1 = torch.tensor(3)  # 3 predictors
    >>> f_test_sample_size(effect_size, df1, power=0.8)
    tensor(100)

    Notes
    -----
    The sample size calculation is based on the noncentral F-distribution.
    For a general F-test with effect size f² and degrees of freedom df1,
    the required total sample size N is calculated such that:

    λ = N * f²

    achieves the desired power, where λ is the noncentrality parameter.

    The calculation starts with an initial approximation based on normal
    distribution theory:

    N ≈ ((z_α + z_β) / √f²)² / df1

    Then iteratively refines this estimate to account for the finite sample
    F-distribution properties.

    For regression contexts:
    - f² = R²/(1-R²) where R² is the coefficient of determination
    - For comparing nested models: f² = (R²_full - R²_reduced)/(1-R²_full)
    - Total sample size N should be at least df1 + 5 for stable results

    Cohen's f² effect size interpretation:
    - Small effect: f² = 0.02
    - Medium effect: f² = 0.15
    - Large effect: f² = 0.35
